Then you will be made to choose a difficulty setting, there are four to choose from during your first run. See below:</p><table class="ffaq"><tbody><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Description</th><th>Enemies</th></tr><tr><td>Friendly Neighborhood</td><td>For players who want minimal combat challenge, Miles will not be knocked out in combat</td><td><p>Very low Aggressiveness,<br>Very low Damage and<br>Very low health</p></td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>For players who want to enjoy the story without challenging combat.</td><td>Mild aggressiveness,<br>Low damage and<br>Mild Health levels</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing</td><td>For players who want a balanced experience with some challenge.</td><td>All values are normal</td></tr><tr><td>Spectacular</td><td>For players who enjoy challenging combat. Enemies will be stronger and more aggressive.</td><td>Higher than Normal Aggressiveness <br>High Health and Damage</td></tr><tr><td>Ultimate</td><td>*Unlocked only after beating the Story once and can be played on NG and NG+<br>This setting is for expert player who enjoy a brutally difficult experience</td><td>Very High aggressiveness<br>VERY VERY HIGH damage<br>Very high health</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the construction of this guide i will be playing on Spectacular. During my first run.</p><p>Once selected the game will let you mess with the settings, for camera angles, sound and accessibility, you can also rewatch the recap. Do whatever you want here and then choose Start to begin.</p><h4>Getting into the swing of things: Prologue<a id="getting-into-the-swing-of-things-prologue"></a></h4><p>After the opening scenes you will be immediately thrust into swinging around new york as Miles. Use this time to get a feel for swinging around the city. Head towards the yellow marker on the , you can also use the touch pad to see the Map of the city and your current mission. You can also check your moves list. Players who have played Spiderman Ps4 will likely already have some idea of how to play however.</p><h5>Story mission: Hold on to your web shooters<br>Location: Harlem (going to Midtown), Reward: 3500 XP<a id="story-mission-hold-on-to-your-web-shooterslocation-harlem-going-to-midtown-reward-3500-xp"></a></h5><p>Head towards the marked location on the map. After come scenes you will be fighting a bunch of crooks, this is a good place to get used to the combat, use the move list as reference and get used to, fighting enemies, remember to make use of your webs to string up enemies, and to dodge attacks. You can also heal with down button after filling up the gauge. Watch out for gun toading goons you will either need to beat them down just take away their guns, by holding triangle.</p><p>After enough fighting the goons will escape and Rhino will start rampaging, so its time for a chase, follow behind Rhino and Pete as they rodeo through the city Make sure to keep pace and if Rhino throws something your way use circle to dodge.</p><p>After a bit of chasing close in on Rhino and start riding him, with the given button commands. You will need to use the left stick to steer this wild Rhino, hitting objects and pillars will cause you to lose health, so avoid that. There will also be a few quick time events during this segment.</p><p>Then more chasing and finally you will be fighting more goons. This group has a lot of guns and a couple rocket launchers, time your dodging as best you can to avoid damage and heal when needed. You will need to move to a nearby roof top twice for more enemies. Either way watch your health, the game will also explain finishers, which requires a 15 hit combo before execution.</p><p>After all the goons are done and finished jump down and get ready for a boss fight. This fight is mainly a tutorial for a power unique to Miles, Venom punch. Normally Rhino barely takes any damage from normal hits and hits hard himself. Hitting him with a Venom punch stuns him and allows you to damage him and build up combos, which if you can bring up to 15 will let you use a finisher on him.</p><p>After the stun wares off though Rhino will attack like a tank. He will either throw things at your or charge at you dodge around to build up your gauge for another venom punch, rinse and repeat until you transition to the next phase.</p><p>During this second phase you will be in a building with more things for Rhino to throw. However dodging some of Rhinos attacks will let you ride him into the wall for damage. From there just repeat the Venom punch cycle till he is beaten.</p><p>After the scenes you will be given access to the skill tree and can unlock Venom smash. Exit the menu and start swinging and then reopen it to view the Skill tab, Social feed and Benchmarks added to the menu. The moves list is also updated and will continue to be as you unlock more.</p><p>Benchmarks are basically actions you can and will perform as you traverse the city and fight enemies, you get 50 XP for each milestone plus a sticker for the last one of each type. These are basically light achievements you can do on the go.</p><p>Anyway you can now freely explore new york at your leisure though there isn't really much you can do right now. Some things you can do however is swing around freely to get a feel for the environment and visit Jefferson Davis' grave in harlem for a trophy. Once ready move on to the next mission.</p><h5>Story mission: Parting Gift<br>Location: Central park, Reward: 1000 XP<a id="story-mission-parting-giftlocation-central-park-reward-1000-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to central park where the quest marker is. After some quick scenes you will gain access to Suits and Suit mods as well as Gadgets. I should also note that playing spiderman ps4 and having save data of it will give 2 new suits aside from the one Miles gets for this event.</p><p>Suits also unlock visor and suit mods which you can equip now. For more information about individual <a href="suits">Suits</a> and <a href="mods">Mods</a> see the appropriate section of this guide.</p><h5>Story mission: New Thwip<br>Location: Harlem, Reward: 3500 XP<a id="story-mission-new-thwiplocation-harlem-reward-3500-xp"></a></h5><p>Now head to the marked location in any suit you want, with any of the mods you have equipped. Once there interact with the terminal, this is the first Challenge, well not really this is just basically more tutorial fighting. Not much to tell you here other than to listen the Peter's advice and practice your moves as much as possible.</p><p>Beating this will earn enough XP to level you up to Level 3. You should now be able to unlock 2 new skills from the skill tab, Venom jump and Energy siphon both cost 1 skill point each and only unlock at level 3 and right now you should have 4 skill points. So get them.</p><p>After that you will unlock the real challenges but not all of them yet. Leave the roof top after the scenes and a new pod cast will play. At this point the city goes live, in other words crimes will now happen through out the city for you to stop there are many different types of Crimes with different objectives and bonus objectives. There is a trophy tied to completing all bonus objectives for every crime type so for further information see the appropriate section. Completing crime missions and bonus objectives gives you activity tokens which in turn let you unlock mods and upgrade gadgets.</p><p>Challenges in 2 areas should now also be open so you can complete them now, depending on your performance you will be ranked and get activity tokens per ranking, you will also be given a new skill upon completion. You will unlock additional challenges of a given type for completing the ones already present, in total you can unlock 4 more Challenges right now for a total of 6.For further information on specific challenges see the Challenge section of this guide.</p><p>When your done messing around with challenges its time to move on.</p><h5>Story Mission: We're Here For You<br>Location: Harlem, Reward: 3500 XP<a id="story-mission-were-here-for-youlocation-harlem-reward-3500-xp"></a></h5><p>Head towards the marked location in harlem. Remember to do any crimes you encounter for the experience and activity points, and in general some good combat practice.</p><p>When you arrive and a scene occurs, zip into the building and interact with a terminal inside. You will be then thrust into a combat segment against a bunch of enemies all using high tech weapons like lazer guns and power gauntlets which block all your attacks, you can break through and damage them more easily with Venom attacks however.</p><p>Fight through their groups moving up onto the roofs and into the buildings until they are finished them examine the big red screen. This will complete the mission, and you will likely reach level 4 or 5 now, depending on how much side stuff you stopped to do. Either way remember to learn new skills. This will be the last time i assume your level. But i will still recommend skills when needed.</p><p>On that note you should have a few new suit and visor mods to get but you need tech parts which you havent unlocked yet. Also some new crime types have been unlocked.</p><h5>Story Mission: La NocheBuena<br>Location: Harlem, Reward: 3500 XP<a id="story-mission-la-nochebuenalocation-harlem-reward-3500-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to Miles' place. Examine the backpack and you will change into not a spidey suit. You can examine a bunch of stuff in Miles room before leaving it so have a look around. Once done head to the living room through the door and after scene examine stuff in the living room as well.</p><p>Now you need to light the tree and get a record from Rio's room, feel free to mess around and examine everything until your ready to those things.</p><p>Then answer the door. After the scenes you have to access the breaker in the back of the hall, though there are a lot background convos you can listen to before hand. Now after the breaker, go to the fire escape outside Miles' room and go out the window. Scale the walls outside and use R3 to scan the area and follow the orange wire. Do not go on the roof , there are people there.</p><p>Reach the transformer and use a Venom attack to jump start it and head back to the living room window and watch the next scenes. This will end the day.</p><h4>Chapter 1<a id="chapter-1"></a></h4><h5>Side Mission: Harlem Trains out of Service<br>Reward: 10 Activity tokens and 3500 XP<a id="side-mission-harlem-trains-out-of-servicereward-10-activity-tokens-and-3500-xp"></a></h5><p>The next day you will be introduced to the Friendly neighborhood app, i.e your side quest app, although its activities are classified differently by the game. You will notice them pop up on the map as city activities. They also give Activity points.</p><p>Swipe left on the controller's touch pad and then select the request. Now head to the location and then the next one. When you arrive follow the wires in the ground to a room and yank the door open to begin a fight.</p><p>Knock down the one guy and then investigate the terminal. After you will be told about Underground Caches. You can use these Caches around new york, this is pretty much the same as backpacks from the previous game except you get Tech parts to upgrade your gadgets, get suits, make mods etc.</p><p>Whenever you enter range of a Cache you will get a compass to help you track the exact location as such i wont include it in a separate section as finding them isn't really difficult, and you can easily find them all right now if you feel like. Note: Some Caches are hidden behind yankable objects or false walls or are guarded by Underground goons. A good way to know the general area is the Underground symbol on the walls nearby. In some case you may need to open a garage with a yank, or open it and then web it to keep it open. Not all Cache's are available and the one of the ones in harlem cannot be accessed.</p><p>There wont be any crimes or other events until you clear the next mission, so this is a good time to collect all the Caches. Either way when ready head to blue triangle marked in hell's kitchen.</p><p>When you arrive you will be basically given a tutorial for stealth missions. After that is done, take out the Underground goons either stealthily or just beat them up. Afterwards you need to solve a train puzzle.</p><p>Start by spinning the center movable platform, to line it up with the tracks going into the tunnel, then pull it forward, then move the platform perpendicular to the tunnel tracks and pull the next train on it and spin it back towards the tunnel. Lastly bring down the train being held by a crane by yanking the gears and then webbing them. If you cant figure out how use R3 to highlight things you can interact with.</p><p>After that follow instructions to start up the generator and apply webbing to the relay. Once your done head to the next objective point.</p><p>When you arrive you will need to fight more goons, but this time you also need to yank and throw the bombs they have set up and then beat them up, then web them in the air. After dealing with them watch the scenes and your "side quest" is completed.</p><p>Now new crimes will start popping up, the last type of challenges: Stealth challenges will unlock allowing you to complete them all. You will also unlock a new side mission plus all <a href="friendly-neighborhood-spiderman-app">FSNM App activities</a>. (see the appropriate section). One important note about the app it lets you INSTANTLY replay crimes you have already completed, meaning you can cause them to reappear to be replayed so you can get activity tokens or bonus objectives. The last cache in harlem you couldnt get before will now also be available (this is not the last cache period but the last one in harlem).</p><p>By now your next main story mission will eventually pop up, but you should take this time to do some side stuff and build yourself up. Namely the remaining challenges (leave stealth for later if you want to get good times on them), app missions and so on. For the the walkthrough i will cover the just unlocked Side mission before moving on and you can find the rest of it in the appropriate sections.</p><h5>Side mission: Looters!!!!<br>Location: Harlem, Rewards: 1500 XP and 10 Activity tokens<a id="side-mission-looterslocation-harlem-rewards-1500-xp-and-10-activity-tokens"></a></h5><p>You can trigger this via the app or by visiting the location marked as a blue triangle on the map. Either way head to the marked location.</p><p>After talking to Teo head to the new marked location and access the hatch. Crawl through the area till you reach an open space with enemies, either using stealth or otherwise take down the enemies. After that Scan the area to find the back up generator and charge it with a Venom punch. After the scene go after the cat by opening the door by yanking the gears above and then webbing them.</p><p>Enter the gap and then when you an elevator shaft hang from the wall with L2 and then lower down with the L stick and enter a vent, with point zip.</p><p>Once inside move through the vent and follow the cat out of the vents. You will now be above more goons. You know the drill. After dealing with them enter the vent in the far room.</p><p>Go through into yet another room like that last. Once your done with the guys here, zap the back up power and then enter the next vent. To the next room full of goons. After dealing with them head up stairs to jump start the back up generator and then use the tether webs on the junction points to the right, then go down and pull the lever.</p><p>Now beat up the guys that show, then grab the cat and zip on up to the exit. When outside take the cat back to Teo to wrap up this mission.</p><p>When your done with side stuff or just wanna move on head to the main mission marker.</p><h5>Story mission: Reconnecting<br>Location: Harlem, Rewards: 1500 XP<a id="story-mission-reconnectinglocation-harlem-rewards-1500-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to the marker and enter the building. Watch the scenes and thats this one finished. That being said you now have access to Time capsules, Miles' version of Backpacks. There are 16 of them hidden around the city, but you can't go looking yet anyway, the game rail roads you into trying the fast travel option which takes you back to Miles' house. This will move immediately to the next mission.</p><h5>Story mission: Time to Rally<br>Location: Harlem, Rewards: 4000 XP<a id="story-mission-time-to-rallylocation-harlem-rewards-4000-xp"></a></h5><p>After the scenes you will immediately be fighting Underground goons, you know the drill. After defeating all these guys, rush over to the next point. Watch the next scenes and then fight more goons.</p><p>Once your done here head further in and get ready for a lot of scene directed button inputs and QTEs. When the dust has settled and the scenes pass the prologue will be at an end.</p><p>Miles will now unlock the classic suit (and some other suits depending on your level) as well as the Camouflage ability. I was at level 10 at this point so my second slots for Visor and Suit mods also unlocked.</p><p>The Camo ability has its own skill tree in the skills menu. New crimes and app missions are now also active. You can also find Time capsules, like the Caches their marked on the map and easy to find, though some may have some requirements for getting to them, such as needing to grab it in stealth, move objects etc, (note some are on moving objects such trains and boats).</p><h4>Chapter 2<a id="chapter-2"></a></h4><h5>Side mission: Final Test<br>Location: Greenwich, Reward: 1000 XP<a id="side-mission-final-testlocation-greenwich-reward-1000-xp"></a></h5><p>This mission unlocks when you complete all 9 challenges regardless of rank I'm including it here and the Challenges section just in case, it should be very possible for you to have finished each challenge at this point as well.</p><p>Go to the marked location and access the challenge terminal, you will fight a fake Vulture boss. You have to defeat them while it in the air. This boss is pretty annoying but simple to defeat, simply dodge his attacks in the air and when he thros projectiles yank and throw them back at him then follow the prompts to close in and beat him down you can also mix in Venom attacks etc.</p><p>Rinse repeat and eventually he'll call a second Vulture to fight you. Defeat both Vultures to clear this mission. What makes this fight hard, if anything is needing to stay in the air while dealing with not one but 2 vultures, dodging them countering them and of course beating them. All in all its a matter of practice and timing.</p><h5>Story mission: Someone Left the lights on.....<br>Location: Midtown, Reward: 4500 XP<a id="story-mission-someone-left-the-lights-onlocation-midtown-reward-4500-xp"></a></h5><p>Now once your done with all your side stuff or just want to move on head on to the new main mission marker.</p><p>When you arrive zip in through a window. You can examine a backpack as you walk further in. Then check the work station and check the board and the ID on the desk. After that go further in and check the table with the backpack on it.</p><p>Now check the big purple glowing wall, smash with a venom punch. Now examine all the objects inside this room. After the scenes go into Camo when prompted and then take down the enemies one way or the other before continuing the scenes and finishing up this mission.</p><p>Now you have two new Side missions so lets cover those before moving on, both are in Harlem.</p><h5>Side Mission: Harlem F.E.A.S.T Shut Down<br>Reward: 1500 XP, 10 Activity tokens<a id="side-mission-harlem-feast-shut-downreward-1500-xp-10-activity-tokens"></a></h5><p>Head to the location. and enter the building. (note this quest may be buggy at least on ps4 no confirmation but just based on my experience nothing major though if you have problems restart from last checkpoint).<br>As Miles walk up to and speak to the woman in green under the tent, then walk across the street to the park and speak to 3 people here and then walk back to feast and head for the door to change.</p><p>Now scan and follow the pipes to a storm drain and yank out the trash. Follow the pipes again. Beat up the guys here and interact with the pump.</p><p>Now go to each one of the 3 valves. For one of them you need to turn the valve and then let the water pressure reach the middle and web up the spraying water. One of them just has you removing a trash can from in front of it. The last has some enemies near it, this one is buggy in that the prompt to turn off the valve may not appear restart from check point to fix it.</p><p>Now head to the next location and take down the next group of goons. Once done start up the pump and head on back to feast and speak to Gloria to finish up.</p><p>Now on to the next one.</p><h5>Side Mission: Robbers target Local Biz<br>Reward: 1500 XP, 10 Activity tokens<a id="side-mission-robbers-target-local-bizreward-1500-xp-10-activity-tokens"></a></h5><p>Head to the location and speak to the man sweeping. Then go to the next location. Use Camo and hide from the police use scan to find a ticket near foot prints and then Use webbing to distract one guy looking at a jack and then check the jacket (all while being unseen). Then head to the next location in Chinatown.</p><p>You will then have a car chase, catch up to the car and deal with it like usual and then yank the trunk open. Then head to the next location.<br>You will now have a stealth mission which you fail if you are seen. Get close to any yellow glowing group while cloaked or otherwise and listen in with R3.</p><p>Once done take them out to make things easier and move on to the next group until you find the stuff. Once you have the info from the third group in you can take all of them out with no sneaking needed. Now find the green crate with a white star nearby, with some scaffolding blocking it.</p><p>Now zip up to the crane and yank and web it to lift the other crate, approach the crate and then more guys show up. Beat them up and yank open the container to finish this one.</p><h5>Story mission: Corporate Espionage<br>Reward: 4500 XP<a id="story-mission-corporate-espionagereward-4500-xp"></a></h5><p>When you arrive at the location, scan the building to find a way to turn off the power. Stealth take down all the guys out front and then yank open the place the pipes lead and then follow the prompts to shut it down. Now zip inside.</p><p>As you go through the vents web up the fans to advance. Make your way through until you reach an area where you need lower down by hanging, immediately enter Camo and then climb up as enemies approach and the take down those you can find an opening for.</p><p>Then head inside the door they just came from for a scene.</p><p>Head through the vent and the game will now tutorialize the new gadget Remote mines for you. Eliminate the guys here and enter the vent highlighted. Go through the vent and out the other end to find another room with guys in it.</p><p>Stealth take down them all using Remote mines etc and then access the terminal. You will now unlock some more side stuff for later.</p><p>Now zip into the next room.</p><p>You have another stealth section and remember you get caught you will need to restart. Take them down one at a time using whatever method you prefer. After their all gone, jump down to the platform next to the huge fan and then yank and web the gear. Now follow the prompt to destroy the wiring.</p><p>When your done go and grab the phone. Now walk to the reactor and follow the prompt. Now limp out of there. Make your way through and you will be in a fight segment. After a point the enemies will overwhelm you and you will need to exit through a wall.</p><p>Once you do the mission is finished.</p><p>Now you have some more side stuff, 1 new crime and 3 Roxxon labs to get rid of. These labs also have some of the remaining Caches in them, each also has their own bonus conditions. These are the same as the <a href="enemy-bases">hideout raids</a> from the previous games, there are 3 of them you can raid right now see the appropriate section for details.</p><p>When you're finished with all the side stuff you feel like doing head to the next marked location to continue the main story.</p><h5>Story mission: Underground Undercover<br>Reward: 4500 XP<a id="story-mission-underground-undercoverreward-4500-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to the location and head through the door. After the scenes follow the person with you as the scene progresses. Once inside the base examine the sword and then put it back (be warned this segment can be glitched restart from check point if there is a problem).</p><p>Use R3 to scan and then check all of the gold glowing objects. Once done head to where the marker points. After the scenes its back to spidey action.</p><p>Zip up to the vent and move through them. And you will be in a large training room, dealing with the enemies here and then approach the large Samurai statue and yank it. Go down the stairs and start the elevator and go down. Watch the scenes and Venom Dash will unlock now defeat the enemies, the underground enemies will now use swords which extend and which let them counter most of your attacks except Venom dash.</p><p>Once your done leave the building and this mission is complete.</p><p>You will now have a bunch more side stuff opened up. For starters a (and the last) new crime, 3 new bases (and caches) to raid and a new side quest.</p><h5>Side mission: Matter up<br>Reward: 100 XP and a new suit.<a id="side-mission-matter-upreward-100-xp-and-a-new-suit"></a></h5><p>This side mission opens after you beat all the hideouts.

Deal with the guys here and then scan the area and find some gears to yank and web. Then enter the garage and scan again and yank open the power box and push the button.</p><p>Yank open these doors and walk around and examine everything in the room leave the PC for last though. When you examine the PC you will get a scene.<br> (there is a glitch where the other person will for reason not be voiced i have no idea why this happened but it did on my end i quit and reopened the game to fix it).</p><p>Now leave the hideout and head to the next marker (the park again).

So yeah go around the area beating up mooks and draining generators until none are left, and then return to the door and Venom smash it.</p><p>Once inside, scan and find some gears to yank and web, then proceed through the opening. Then in the large open space access the terminal. After that follow the wires and Venom punch the generators they lead to (there are many examinable locations here so look around, there is even an extra cache behind a breakable wall), for one of them you need to set up a relay using webs, another is behind a breakable wall and you will need to Venom Smash it to start it, the last one requires you to yank and web some gears, and then set up a relay using webs after starting it.</p><p>Now return to the Terminal. After that you will have more goons to deal with. Eventually a new heavy type of Underground goon will show up with a shield and hammer, use venom punch to deal with him. Once done watch the scenes and then you will chasing Tinkerer throughout the city.</p><p>Not much to say about this segment just dont lose her. Eventually you will be scaling a building but will need to dodge giant wheels being throw at you as you go. Once that's done this mission is finished.</p><p>Now you will have some free time after this mission till you get the next story objective so maybe do some left over side stuff if your up for it. Eventually you will get a call about where to go next, takes maybe 5 minutes.</p><h5>Story mission: Breaking through the Noise<br>Location: Hell's kitchen, Reward: 5000 XP<a id="story-mission-breaking-through-the-noiselocation-hells-kitchen-reward-5000-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to the marked area and after the scenes walk up to the hologram and examine it. You will now be given a tutorial on how to collect the sound samples, another activity for city exploration. Overall these are really simple, you arrive at the location, interact with the hologram and then hold L2 to scan for a similar sound to the one given, when finding the correct position and recording it you will complete this activity.</p><p><br>You will find the correct sound on the pile of containers to your right while standing on it looking to the right of how you were facing the hologram. See the <a href="sound-samples">Sound Sample</a> section for the rest.</p><p>After your done watch the scenes. You will now be in Miles' apartment, you can wander around and examine stuff. When ready leave and you will now be able go collect those sound samples, i recommend doing this now since their quick and easy but it's up to you.</p><h5>Side Mission: Back to the beginning <br>Location: Harlem, Reward: 100 XP and a new suit<a id="side-mission-back-to-the-beginning-location-harlem-reward-100-xp-and-a-new-suit"></a></h5><p>After you find all of the sound samples you will be given this side quest and will need to complete it before moving on. Head to the marked location and under the bridge you will find a vent into the ground, go down it. You can examine a lot of stuff in here, when ready, examine the locker in the back, you will get the Purple reign suit.</p><p>Now when your done with side stuff head to the market location for the main story. There will be no major side content or city exploration activities after this though there are two more side missions.</p><h5>Story Mission: Tinker Tailor Spider Spy<br>Location: Financial district, Reward: 6000 XP<a id="story-mission-tinker-tailor-spider-spylocation-financial-district-reward-6000-xp"></a></h5><p>During the scenes follow the button prompt and then follow the other person out of the room. Once in a room full of PCs check the one in front. When prompted go up into the vent and then find and Venom punch the generator in there. I should also note that now you have learnt a new skill called Mega Venom Blast which requires 3 full venom bars.</p><p>Follow the vents and then exit them. In the next area you know the drill, take down the goons. After their done enter the back room there are some extra PCs to interact with here (aside from the one to advance the story), and there is an extra cache here as well scan to know where they are. Once ready access the terminal which will advance the story.</p><p>Now go to the door (you can talk to your ally a few times). Then after the scenes move through the underground area until you arrive at a locked point, venom punch the generator to keep moving.</p><p>In the next area venom punch another generator, after that move to the other side of the room and yank the big crane and then yank it back. Then set up a relay using webs from the generator to the crane, then yank the crane to the other side again and then connect that relay to the one next to the laser.</p><p>Now walk up to the engine and venom punch it, then web throw it at the shutters.</p><p>In the next area you will be in another stealth and battle segment. This time there are guys with goggles which can see you while in Camo, so get rid of them first if you wanna stick to stealth. When your done with all the goons here exit out of the vent on the far end of the room near the roxxon sign.</p><p>After the next scenes you will enter a boss fight. Your up against Rhino again but this time Venom attacks have no effect, dodge his attacks until you can ride him and then ride him in a tank and then beat him up but avoid using Venom attacks. Leave the goons to your ally. Rhino as he is can use attacks similar to Roxxon goons with weapons, which will prevent you from using your venom.</p><p>After doing the above enough times Rhino will throw a tank at you, dodge and the Venom punch the engine and web throw it at rhino then beat him up to break more armor. Keep doing this until eventually his armor is fully broken.</p><p>Once that's done its the same as the first boss, except with the new anti venom moves and more goons. You can also still ride him into tanks as well, and land finishing blows when he's down. A fast way to finish him is to charge up multiple gauges of venom and a use venom punch followed by a beat down and when he recovers to immediately repeat until he's finished, sprinkle in a finisher here are there and your done.</p><p>After the scenes you will be in Miles' place, you can examine stuff again, and when your done head to the window and leave. You now have to wait till the next story marker appears so get some side stuff done if you want.</p><p>Also i should note your level is limited to 20 in the first playthrough, so if you've reached this any XP you get now will disappear into the ether.</p><h5>Story mission: Thicker than Blood<br>Location: Upper West side, Reward: 5000 XP<a id="story-mission-thicker-than-bloodlocation-upper-west-side-reward-5000-xp"></a></h5><p>Head to the marked location, but.........you wont make it.</p><p>You will now have a boss fight. Your opponent during his first phase will rely on his fist, but can also cloak and disappear, he can easily be dealt with by beating on him and them using venom attacks before he disappears. During the second phase he will add several moves to his arsenal, a beam attack, throwing bombs which weaken venom, a claw attack etc. The key is to dodge him and perfect dodge him and then counter with venom and beat downs.</p><p>During his third phase he creates 3 holo grams to fight with him, these go down pretty easily after a venom attack otherwise its more of the same, just keep chipping away at him with attacks and venom attacks, you can also use finishers.</p><p>After the scenes this mission is done. Now this is the point of no return, the last time you can upgrade gadgets, suits, mods or do side activities. So when your ready head to the marked location for the final few Story missions.</p><h5>Story mission: Like real scientists<br>Location Upper west side, Reward: 5500 XP<a id="story-mission-like-real-scientistslocation-upper-west-side-reward-5500-xp"></a></h5><p>Once you arrive take down the goons at the entrance however you want. Then head to the main building to the marked point and you have another 4 way generator door puzzle. This time the generators are locked behind gates. See that huge spinning contraption above yank it into the right position and then use webs to connect the relay to the ones near the small rooms the generators are locked in, this will open the doors and let you drain the generators.</p><p>One of them has the relay behind some breakable objects and another requires you to connect the relay to the one on your left before connecting it to the one which will open the generator door. Now return to the no longer electrified door and venom smash it.</p><p>Once inside you can examine the screen. Now go down the purple hallway, there is an extra cache here as well. Follow the hall and then Zip on up.</p><p>In the large room head to the next marker, and open the door. You will now transition to a Miles segment flashback. Just follow along with the scene, you can examine a lot of extra stuff here too. Eventually you'll come to the large main hall. There is a trophy here, go to the large circular exhibit with rockets and and interact with it to play a button mash mini game. Beat Phin to get the trophy.</p><p>When your done looking around head to the marker. Then examine to door and then use scan to find the 2 exhibits you need to swipe from to get through the door. After grabbing the second ones you will get some nice cameos.</p><p>Now head to the door and then change the shape to a semi circle one and point the reflector to the right and press square. Then just move forward through the hall and into the elevator.</p><p>Examine the Energy converter and watch the scenes. As the scene ends you have another battle sequence. Once your done here make your way out for another fight segment. Once you have beaten everyone here zip out the sky light and this mission is done, the next one can be started immediately by heading to the marked location and all other side stuff is locked.</p><h5>Story mission: Battle for Harlem<br>Rewards: 6000 XP<a id="story-mission-battle-for-harlemrewards-6000-xp"></a></h5><p>When you arrive the enemies are surrounded in fog, so use R3 to keep them insight and take them out. Note this segment is liable to lag on ps4, or just possibly older ps4's either way i experienced a lot of lag here.</p><p>Keep fighting your way through enemy group after enemy group until scenes occur. After the scenes you will have the Final boss.</p><p>The final boss is fast and uses a sword long reaching attacks which are hard to avoid even with dodging, they will change between the undergrounds fists and swords to damage you close range, which means they have the same weakness, build up venom and break their weapons with venom attacks. The key here is to avoid enough blows and land enough to get venom charged and damaging them with venom as much as possible.</p><p>After you do enough damage a scene plays and the second phase starts. They can now make a cannon firing a large laser which can restrain you and then they will follow with a smash attack plus their previous moves. Do the same as before while avoiding their attacks.</p><p>After you do enough damage phase 3 starts, unlike before the final boss switches to long range attacks, they create a cannon which fires at you on its own (and can be yanked and thrown back at them) and starts firing at you themselves with an attack which creates traps on the ground. A good way to counter them is to throw their cannon back at them and then zip at them and lay into them with attacks and venom attacks, repeat this process till the next transition.</p><p>You will now enter the final phase. For this one they will start blasting you with large wheels which you can dodge, just keep dodging until they get tired, or if they change to a different weapon simply change to whatever tactics you used against that weapon.<br>(Venom dash against sword, zip and venom punch for gun etc).</p><p>Eventually they will run out of health, now just play the story as needed dealing with any prompts (or movement). Sit back and enjoy the ending.</p><h4>Post game<a id="post-game"></a></h4><p>Yeah......there's more. Now that the main story is finished you can select mission replay to replay any missions, replay FNSM missions, change the time of day from options. And can start a new game on Ultimate difficulty or NG+ (Or NG+ on Ultimate). There are many skills, mods and a suit only obtainable in NG+.</p><p>And aside from all that you have some new side stuff to finish. Head to the marked location for a side mission.</p><h5>Side mission: Cat's Pyjamas<a id="side-mission-cats-pyjamas"></a></h5><p>Simply go to Teo's Bodega and pet the cat and you will get a new suit that is all. A new side mission is now unlocked as well.</p><h5>Side mission: Memory lane<a id="side-mission-memory-lane"></a></h5><p>Go to Miles' house and head inside by interacting with the bagpack. Once inside sleep on the bad. You will then be given a scavenger hunt mission. This is the final city exploration activity only available now.
